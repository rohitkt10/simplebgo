# simplebgo
A collection of Bayesian global optimization tools. 
 
**Currently under construction**

# What we can do:

1. Bayesian global optimization with box constraints and real valued inputs. 

# Coming soon....

1. Example scripts for 1D and 2D functions. 
2. BGO with inequality constraints. 
3. BGO with integer-valued inputs. 

# How to use:
Clone this repository into your site-packages folder. 
The BayesianOptimizer class can be called using: 
```python
from simplebgo import BayesianOptimizer
```
